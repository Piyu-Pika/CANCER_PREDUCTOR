# Cancer Predictor 🩺💻

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of cancer based on various features and data. The project was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a reliable and accurate model for cancer prediction. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, the following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for effective model training. 📊🔍
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identified and engineered relevant features from the data to improve model performance. ⚙️
3. **Model Training**: Trained and evaluated various machine learning models for cancer prediction. 🧠🔬
4. **Model Deployment**: Prepared the trained model for deployment and integration into a user-friendly application. 🚀

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook files with the code, analysis, and visualizations for the project. 📓
